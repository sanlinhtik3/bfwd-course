    "description": "Our goal is simple: we want to empower designers and agencies from all (UX, brand, product, graphic, fashion, industrial, and short track speed skating) to build a CMS-driven portfolio in 21 days that will generate leads — and potentially tear a hole in the very fabric of space and time. We included everything we learned about content strategy, information architecture, and quantum mechanics to create a course unlike any other course in the past, present, or future."
